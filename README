videohubctrl - Blackmagic Videohub control application
======================================================

Blackmagic Design Videohub is SDI router device which can be controlled
over the network using very simple text based protocol which
videohubctrl implements.

videohubctrl is tested with Blackmagic Design Micro Videohub 16x16
router and probably will work with other Videohub models.

videohubctrl currently displays:

  - Input port labels
  - Output port labels
  - Output routing
  - Output locking

The following features found in bigger Videohub models are currently not
supported (I don't have the hardware):

  - Configuration of video processing units
  - Configuration of Video monitoring outputs
  - Configuration of Serial ports

Configuration of Videohub's network settings can be made using
Blackmagic's Windows program when the device is connected via USB.


License
=======

videohubctrl is released under MIT license.
See LICENSE-MIT.txt for full license terms.


Development
===========

The development is done using git. videohubctrl repository is hosted at

   http://github.com/gfto/videohubctrl

To clone the repository issue the following commands:

   git clone git://github.com/gfto/videohubctrl.git
   cd videohubctrl
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   make

The code is developed and tested under modern Linux. It's also compiled
from time to time under OS X but it's not tested there.


Updating the code
=================

To update cloned videohubctrl, go to the directory where the repository
is cloned and run the following commands:

   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/master
   git submodule update
   make clean all

videohubctrl's master branch should always be useful so it is safe to
use it instead of official release. The master branch will always
be better than any released version.


Command line parameters
=======================

videohubctrl is controlled using command line parameters. Here is a list
of supported command line parameters:

 Usage: videohubctrl --host <host> [..commands..]

Main options:
 -s --host <hostname>       | Set device hostname.
